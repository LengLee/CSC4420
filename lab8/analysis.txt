the behavior for the memory usuage gets higher every point because i open more applications everytime. causing the usage to get higher than before. 

Similarly the Buffer and the Cache lso reacts in similar ways. They both increase for the first 3 states then decreases then increase a little. this is because of the different type of apps opened doesn't require the buffer and cache much which cause it to drop until the 5th state. 

The Swap increases throughout all 5 times because all of them have room to grow after each free of the memory/.
